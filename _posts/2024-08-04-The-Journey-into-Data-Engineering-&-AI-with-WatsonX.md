Today, I’m excited to share the revamped version of my portfolio—built to reflect the modern tech landscape that I’m passionate about. My previous site was functional but needed a makeover, just like the ever-evolving tech stack I work with. This new iteration better represents my skills and experience in back-end development, cloud infrastructure, and—most importantly—Data Engineering & WatsonX.

Over the years, I’ve realized that data engineering and AI, particularly with tools like WatsonX, have become the cornerstone of my expertise. Here’s a quick look into some of the areas I focus on:

### Data Engineering & WatsonX
I work extensively with tools like AWS Glue, Redshift, and Athena to build scalable data pipelines. WatsonX is my go-to for ensuring data governance and integrating AI into business workflows.

### Cloud Infrastructure
With platforms like AWS, I’ve been automating cloud-native apps using Terraform and setting up scalable environments with EC2, S3, and Kubernetes.

### DevOps
From using Docker to orchestrate containers to managing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub, I ensure smooth deployments and system stability.

This site will not only showcase my projects but also feature my thoughts on the latest in AI, cloud, and data engineering. Stay tuned!
