# Introduction

Structured Query Language (**SQL**) is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is crucial for anyone working with databases, whether as a beginner or a pro. In this guide, we will cover **all SQL commands**, including **DDL (Data Definition Language)**, **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**, **DQL (Data Query Language)**, and **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**. Each section comes with simple explanations and examples to help you understand and use SQL effectively.

## 🌐 What is SQL?

SQL is a standard language used to interact with relational databases. It allows users to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** data stored in a database. SQL consists of several categories of commands:

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)** - Defines and modifies database structures.
2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** - Manipulates the data in the tables.
3. **DQL (Data Query Language)** - Retrieves data from the database.
4. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** - Manages transactions within the database.

## 🔧 SQL Commands Overview

### 1. **DDL - Data Definition Language**

DDL commands define the database schema. These include commands like **CREATE**, **ALTER**, **DROP**, and **TRUNCATE**.

#### Examples:

- **CREATE**: Creates a new table.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    position VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```

- **ALTER**: Modifies an existing table.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN salary INT;
  ```

- **DROP**: Deletes a table or a database.
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE employees;
  ```

- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table but keeps the structure.
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
  ```

### 2. **DML - Data Manipulation Language**

DML commands allow for data manipulation within the tables. Common DML commands include **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**.

#### Examples:

- **INSERT**: Adds new records to a table.
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO employees (id, name, position, salary)
  VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Manager', 50000);
  ```

- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records.
  ```sql
  UPDATE employees
  SET salary = 55000
  WHERE id = 1;
  ```

- **DELETE**: Deletes records from a table.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
  ```

### 3. **DQL - Data Query Language**

DQL consists of the **SELECT** statement, which retrieves data from the database.

#### Example:

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT name, position FROM employees WHERE salary > 30000;
  ```

### 4. **TCL - Transaction Control Language**

TCL commands manage database transactions and include **COMMIT**, **ROLLBACK**, and **SAVEPOINT**.

#### Examples:

- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made in the transaction.
  ```sql
  COMMIT;
  ```

- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes the changes made in the current transaction.
  ```sql
  ROLLBACK;
  ```

- **SAVEPOINT**: Creates a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
  ```sql
  SAVEPOINT save1;
  ```

## 🗂️ SQL Data Types

SQL supports several data types, which can be grouped into the following categories:

1. **Numeric Types**: Stores numerical values.
   - **INT**: Integer values.
   - **FLOAT**: Floating-point numbers.
   
   Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
     product_id INT,
     price FLOAT
   );
   ```

2. **String Types**: Stores text.
   - **VARCHAR(n)**: Variable-length strings.
   - **CHAR(n)**: Fixed-length strings.

   Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE customers (
     customer_id INT,
     name VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

3. **Date and Time Types**: Stores date and time values.
   - **DATE**: For dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - **TIMESTAMP**: For date and time values.

   Example:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
     order_id INT,
     order_date DATE
   );
   ```

## 📊 SQL Constraints

SQL constraints are used to define rules for the data in a table. These constraints include:

1. **PRIMARY KEY**: Ensures each record in a table is unique.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
     id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

2. **FOREIGN KEY**: Ensures referential integrity between two tables.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
     order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     customer_id INT,
     FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
   );
   ```

3. **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE products (
     product_id INT,
     product_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

4. **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
     id INT UNIQUE,
     email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
   );
   ```

5. **CHECK**: Ensures the values in a column meet a specific condition.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
     id INT,
     salary INT,
     CHECK (salary > 0)
   );
   ```

## 🛠️ Advanced SQL Topics

Once you're comfortable with the basics, here are a few advanced SQL concepts to explore:

1. **JOINS**: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
   - **INNER JOIN**: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
   - **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right.
   
   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT orders.order_id, customers.name
   FROM orders
   INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
   ```

2. **INDEXING**: Improves query performance by creating an index on columns.
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_customer_name ON customers (name);
   ```

3. **VIEWS**: Creates virtual tables.
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
   SELECT name, position FROM employees WHERE salary > 30000;
   ```

4. **STORED PROCEDURES**: Encapsulates a set of SQL statements for reuse.
   ```sql
   CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails()
   BEGIN
     SELECT * FROM employees;
   END;
   ```

## 🚀 Conclusion

SQL is an essential skill for database management and data manipulation. Whether you're working with simple queries or managing complex transactions, mastering SQL will empower you to work efficiently with databases. Start with basic queries, practice manipulating data, and explore advanced topics like joins, views, and stored procedures as you progress.

Happy coding!
