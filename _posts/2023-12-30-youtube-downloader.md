## üìú How to Download a YouTube Playlist

The following script downloads all videos from a specified YouTube playlist. Here‚Äôs how it works:

### Script: `download_playlist.py`

```python
import yt_dlp

def download_playlist(playlist_url, download_path):
    ydl_opts = {
        'format': 'bestvideo+bestaudio/best',
        'merge_output_format': 'mp4',  # You can change to 'mkv' if needed
        'outtmpl': f'{download_path}/%(title)s.%(ext)s',
        'noplaylist': False,  # Set to True to download only one video
    }

    with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
        ydl.download([playlist_url])

playlist_url = 'https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLihCJJ6_IteEo46nNNA4ksZw7ITDQ7nkS'
download_path = 'D:/Yt_videos'
download_playlist(playlist_url, download_path)
```

### How to Run:

1. Replace `playlist_url` with the playlist you want to download.
2. Update `download_path` with your preferred folder to store the videos.
3. Run the script using:

```bash
python download_playlist.py
```

This script downloads all videos from the playlist to the specified directory, saving them in `.mp4` format by default.

## üé• How to Download a Single YouTube Video

Need just one video? Here‚Äôs a script to download a single video:

### Script: `download_video.py`

```python
import yt_dlp

def download_video(video_url, download_path):
    ydl_opts = {
        'format': 'bestvideo+bestaudio/best',
        'merge_output_format': 'mp4',  # Change to 'mkv' if preferred
        'outtmpl': f'{download_path}/%(title)s.%(ext)s',
        'noplaylist': True,  # Ensures only one video is downloaded
    }

    with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
        ydl.download([video_url])

video_url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoHPhLV43gg'
download_path = 'E:/Yt_single_videos'
download_video(video_url, download_path)
```

### How to Run:

1. Replace `video_url` with the YouTube video URL.
2. Set your desired `download_path`.
3. Execute the script using:

```bash
python download_video.py
```

The video will be saved in the specified folder in `.mp4` format.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing the Scripts

Both scripts are flexible. Here are some adjustments you can make:

- **Format:** Change the `'merge_output_format': 'mp4'` to `'mkv'` if you prefer a different video format.
- **Output Template:** Modify the `'outtmpl': f'{download_path}/%(title)s.%(ext)s'` to change the naming and directory structure.
- **Download Path:** Ensure your download path is properly set, especially if you‚Äôre using different drives or OS environments.
