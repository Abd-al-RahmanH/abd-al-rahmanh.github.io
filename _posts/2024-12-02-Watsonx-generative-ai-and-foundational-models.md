## ‚ö° Key AI Terms and Definitions

### 1. **Artificial Intelligence**
The simulation of human intelligence by machines, enabling them to perform tasks like reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.

### 2. **Machine Learning**
A subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make decisions based on statistical predictions.

### 3. **Deep Learning**
A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process vast amounts of data. It excels at handling unstructured data like images and text.

### 4. **Foundation Models**
Specific types of deep learning models built using neural network architectures like transformers. These models are pre-trained on vast datasets and fine-tuned for specific tasks.

### 5. **Generative AI**
AI algorithms capable of creating new content such as text, images, code, or audio. Unlike traditional AI, generative AI generates outputs rather than simply recognizing patterns.

### 6. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
A type of foundation model trained on extensive text datasets using self-supervised learning. LLMs can perform tasks ranging from natural language understanding to code generation.

### 7. **Hallucination**
A phenomenon in LLMs where the system generates incorrect or nonsensical outputs that may appear plausible.

### 8. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
Technology that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in text or spoken forms.

### 9. **Prompt**
The input or query used to interface with AI models. Well-crafted prompts can improve the accuracy and relevance of AI responses.

### 10. **Prompt Engineering**
The process of designing effective prompts to optimize the performance of AI models.

### 11. **Decoder-only Model**
Models designed specifically for generative AI tasks, such as GPT-based architectures.

### 12. **Encoder-only Model**
Models optimized for non-generative tasks, such as text classification or sentiment analysis.

### 13. **Encoder-Decoder Model**
Models that combine encoding and decoding mechanisms, supporting both generative and non-generative tasks efficiently.

### 14. **Tokens**
Units of text (e.g., words, subwords, or characters) used by AI models. Tokenization is the process of converting text into these units for model processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models are AI models that have already been trained on large datasets to perform general tasks. These models can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, saving time and computational resources.

### Benefits of Pre-trained Models:
1. **Faster Development**: Avoid starting from scratch.
2. **Cost-Effective**: Reduce training costs by leveraging existing models.
3. **High Accuracy**: Benefit from the vast amount of data and computational power used during pre-training.

### Examples of Pre-trained Models in Watsonx.ai:
1. **Text Models**: LLMs for tasks like summarization, translation, and content generation.
2. **Image Models**: Models trained for image recognition and object detection.
3. **Code Models**: Models optimized for generating and debugging code.
