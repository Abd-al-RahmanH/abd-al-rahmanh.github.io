# Hi there! I'm Abdul Rahman

I'm a **Data Engineer**, **AWS & DevOps Engineer**, and **Python Developer**.

## About Me

I specialize in data engineering with a strong focus on building scalable and efficient data pipelines, cloud architecture, and automation. I have extensive experience working with **AWS**, **DevOps** practices, and **Python** for data processing, automation, and cloud infrastructure management.

Currently, I work at **Datagen Systems**, where I play a key role in implementing **Watsonx** solutions. As our company is partnered with **IBM**, this collaboration has provided me deep insights into **AI/ML** technologies and the power of **Watsonx** for data-driven innovations.

### Core Skills:
- **Data Engineering**: Designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines for ETL processes.
- **Cloud Technologies**: Architecting and deploying solutions on **AWS**, focusing on scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency.
- **DevOps**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure using **Terraform** and **Ansible**, and containerizing applications with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
- **Python Development**: Writing clean, efficient code for data processing, API integrations, and automation.

## My Journey

Over the years, I’ve taken on diverse roles, contributing to large-scale data projects, cloud migrations, and the automation of workflows across multiple industries. Here’s a snapshot of my professional experiences:

- **IBM Watsonx Projects**: Leveraging **Watsonx** for advanced data analytics, deploying AI models for predictive analytics, and optimizing data pipelines in collaboration with IBM.
- **AWS & DevOps**: Building and managing AWS infrastructure, ensuring smooth deployments with DevOps principles, and automating workflows to increase efficiency.
- **Python Development**: Creating tools and scripts to automate tasks, manage data, and improve workflow efficiency.

I pride myself on my ability to tackle complex technical challenges while focusing on optimizing data pipelines, improving cloud infrastructure, and automating repetitive tasks.
