# Hi there! I'm Abdul Rahman

I'm a **Data Engineer** with strong expertise in **AWS**, **DevOps**, and **Python**.

## What I Do

I design scalable data pipelines, automate workflows, and build cloud-native solutions. At **Datagen Systems**, I lead key projects implementing **IBM Watsonx** for data intelligence and AI-driven transformation.

## Why Data Engineering?

I’ve always enjoyed working with structured systems — turning raw data into something meaningful feels like solving a real-world puzzle. I was drawn to **data pipelines** early on, and over time, found that I enjoy **data engineering** far more than data science. I love building behind-the-scenes systems that power analytics, AI, and real-time decisions.

## Core Skills

- **Data Engineering**: ETL, data pipeline optimization, data governance  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Python Automation**: Scripting, API integration, data processing  
- **IBM Watsonx**: AI/ML solutions, data lineage, metadata management  

## My Experience

I’ve contributed to large-scale data projects, cloud migrations, and enterprise automation efforts, including:

- Full-scale **AWS infrastructure** builds and automation  
- Seamless **CI/CD pipeline** setup with DevOps best practices  
- Advanced data lineage and metadata management using **IBM Watsonx**  
- Collaborating with **IBM** teams to deliver AI-powered data platforms
